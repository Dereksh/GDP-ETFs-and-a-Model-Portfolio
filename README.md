## PROPOSAL

Determine the lowest volatility portfolio of the S&P 500, Dow Jones, Industrial Average, NASDQ, Gold and 10 Year US Government Bond with the 
highest projected return based on a Monte Carlo simulation of future GDP. 

In order to do this we will:

  1. "Flight to Safety" analysis - Look at correlations of each of the equity markets against both gold and the 10 year indivicually.
  2. "How bad is this panic" - See how gold correlates to the 10 year
  3. Regress each asset class against GDP to see how each reacts to changes in GDP
  4. Simulate different model portfolios to find expected return based on a GDP Monte Carlo simulation.
  
  
  ## Technical Requirments
  

   * Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process. 

   * illustrate the final data analysis on Jupyter Notebook. 

   * Create a dashaboard and populate it with the graphs generated using PyViz, Panel, Plotly Express, and Hvplot.
   
   * Save PNG images of visualizations in .readme file.

   * Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.
